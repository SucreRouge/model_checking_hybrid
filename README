=======================
= BRIEF DESCRIPTION
=======================

This application is the attempt to implement model checking (verification and
controller synthesis) for DTLHS. The main idea is using Fourier-Motzkin
procedure to get rid of real variables and using NuSMV software to handle
obtained system.

The latest version of this software is always available at
http://github.com/darth/model_checking_hybrid/

= AUTHORS
=======================

Our development team:

  * Vadim Alimguzhin   <darth@darth.su>

  * Anton Bogin        <anton.bogin@gmail.com>

  * Viktoriya Kozyreva <viktoriya.kozyreva@gmail.com>

  * Denis Makartetskiy <makartetsky@gmail.com>

=======================
= WHAT IS DONE
=======================

At this moment the following process is implemented:

  1) read DTLHS from the input file;

  2) eliminate output variables;

  3) make quantization of DTLHS;

  4) eliminate real parts of variables;

  5) build equisatisfiable CNFs for the systems of linear constraints from
     DTLHS;

  6) compose input file for NuSMV software;

  7) launch verification using NuSMV;

  8) read counterexample from xml file, if verification process fails.

=======================
= TODO
=======================

Implement:

 * building SMV model directly using CUDD OBDD package;

 * working with NuSMV through its api;

 * complete the whole chain (both verification and controller synthesis).

=======================
= BUILDING
=======================

Prerequisites:

  * GNU C++ compiler

  * GNU make utility

  * GMP library (with C++ bindings)
    http://gmplib.org/

  * FM library
    Original version:
    http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~pouchet/software/fm/
    We use modified version, it is available at:
    http://github.com/darth/fm_lib_with_gmp/

  * Xerces-C++ library
    http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/

  * Minisat+
    http://minisat.se/MiniSat+.html
    We use slightly modified version, it is included in the sources (directory
    'minisat+').

Run

  % make release

for building release binary.

Run

  % make debug

for building debug binary.

Run

  % make

for building both of them.

Run
  
  % make clean

for cleaning after (un)successful build.

=======================
= USING
=======================

Prerequisites:

  * NuSMV software
    http://nusmv.irst.itc.it/

Help for the application using can be obtained by invocation it with '-h'
('--help') parameter.

  % ./project.exe -h

  Prototype of model checker for hybrid systems 0.1
  usage: ./project.exe [-v level] [-q value] filename 
         read model from "filename" and verify with "value" of q_param
     or: ./project.exe -h
         print help message

If verbosity value is more than 0 result of intermediate steps are printed to
the standard output.

Examples of input files are in the directory 'examples'. The format is simple and
self-explaining.

=======================
= DOCUMENTATION
=======================

Doxygen documentation can be obtained by running

  % make doc

Doxygen software is needed for this step.
Generated documentation will be in the 'doc' directory.
